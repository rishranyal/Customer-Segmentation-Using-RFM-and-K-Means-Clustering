## 📌 Project Background

Olist, a Portugal-based e-commerce startup, recently launched its online store. Coincidentally, the launch aligned with the onset of COVID-19, which accelerated their growth. However, due to a lack of **targeted marketing**, a significant portion of users fail to return, leading to inefficient marketing spend.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To boost Olist's **marketing conversion rate** by implementing **customer segmentation**, enabling **targeted and cost-effective marketing strategies**.

---

## 📊 Why Customer Segmentation?

Customer segmentation allows businesses to understand different user groups and personalize communication, promotions, and product offerings. This leads to improved engagement, better customer retention, and optimized marketing budgets.

---

## 📈 RFM Analysis Framework

We applied RFM analysis for segmentation:

- **Recency (R)** – Days since the customer's last purchase
- **Frequency (F)** – Total number of transactions made
- **Monetary (M)** – Total amount spent by the customer

---

## 🔍 Insights & Segments Identified

After applying **K-Means clustering**, three distinct customer segments emerged:

---

### 🧡 The Loyal Ones
**Traits**: High spenders, frequent buyers, recent transactions  
**Interpretation**: These are your best customers. They don’t need heavy promotions — just appreciation and retention strategies.

**Recommendation**: Implement a **loyalty program** instead of sending frequent discount codes. Reward them with exclusive perks, early access to sales, or points systems.

---

### ❗ The At-Risk (Likely to Churn)
**Traits**: Moderate spending, long time since last purchase  
**Interpretation**: These users are valuable but inactive.

**Recommendation**: Use **high-impact incentives** (e.g., large one-time discounts), coupled with re-engagement campaigns via email, push notifications, etc.

---

### 😀 The Casual Shoppers
**Traits**: Low spending, moderate recency  
**Interpretation**: These users shop infrequently and spend less.

**Recommendation**: Encourage higher transaction values through **cashback vouchers** with high minimum purchase conditions (e.g., “₹100 off on orders above ₹500”) to drive repeat and bigger purchases.
